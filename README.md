##project description: 
For this project, I want to create an interactive webpage that explores pulp magazine cover art in speculative fiction from the 1920s to the 1950s, paying focus on how women artists and writers influenced the art and writing in pulp magazines and used the medium to push against traditional norms. 

##rationale statement: 
Pulp fiction is often dismissed as lowbrow entertainment that frequently tackled risqué themes of its time, incorporating stories that touched on taboo subjects like murder and sexuality. They are also known to be overtly sexual –and sexist. Female characters in these works typically fell into archetypes of innocent damsels or dangerous seductresses. But the lack of censorship and the profit-driven model of pulp publications also gives writers and artists a chance to push for new and subversive creative directions, as long as it sells. With this freedom, female writers and artists in speculative fiction actually used the genre’s freedom to subvert gender norms and represent more nuanced female experiences. 
The pulp magazine cover art of speculative fiction from this era provides an interesting snapshot of this mix of constraint and rebellion. For example, when illustrator Margaret Brundage took over the covers of Weird Tales magazine, the art still focused a great deal on the female body, but subtly pulled the magazine’s visual style in new directions. While Brundage’s art adhered to the colonial gothic style, occasionally depicting women as vulnerable damsels threatened by non-white figures, her illustrations also gave these female characters a sense of agency and personality.
